# sql-challenge

For this week's challenge, assignment is to design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for an employee database, import CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data.

Step 1 (Data Modeling) was to inspect the csv files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables. Raw csv files can be found in the "data" folder, while the image of the ERD can be found in the "EmployeeSQL" folder as "ERD.png".

Step 2 (Data Engineering) was to create a table schema for each of the 6 csv files and import the data into its corresponding SQL table. ERD pdf description and schema can be found in the "EmployeeSQL" folder as "ERDpdf.pdf" and "employee.sql", respectively.

Step 3 (Data Analysis) was to create a set of SQL queries to retrieve certain data points from the database. The sequel queries can be found in the "EmployeeSQL" folder as "employee_query.sql".
